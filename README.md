- **Trigger**: The pipeline triggers on every push to the `main` branch.
- **Build and Deploy Steps**:
  - The code is checked out.
  - AWS CLI is set up for interactions with AWS services.
  - Files are synced to an S3 bucket (excluding unnecessary files like `.git`, `.github`, and `README.md`).
  - The CloudFront cache is invalidated to reflect the latest changes immediately.

### Note on AWS Secrets
The pipeline uses GitHub Actions secrets for AWS credentials, ensuring sensitive information is securely managed and not exposed in the code.
